They tend to get busy as any high end business with extremely reasonable prices would so I recommend for first timers to not shy away and become familiar with the diverse team. Always treated with a sense of family and respect. Not to forget, the super fresh cut that's too good I can't stop staring at myself, haha. Definitely a barber shop to visit or recommend to your friends.</p>
